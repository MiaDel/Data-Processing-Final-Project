# Data-Processing-Final-Project

The code for this project is in the file final_project_notebook and a preview of the code and output can be seen in Githut. The interactive plots can not be seen in the notebook file. To visualize the graphs there are two options. Firstly, the notebook can be dowloaded and run. If you want to run the whole notebook the data must be dowloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs) and be saved in the same file as the notebook final_project_notebook.ipynb. Secondly, the plots have been uploaded seperatly under the names time_plot.html and severity_plot.html and can be viewed this way.
